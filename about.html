<h2>About This Website</h2>

<p>
    This website, BB <span class="small-text">(Being Black)</span>, was created to talk about Black beauty. 
    I wanted a simple place where I can share things like natural hair care, skincare routines, 
    and beauty tips. The newspaper-style layout and nude tones help keep the site soft and clean.
